 * I don't know if I want to make rrDrive yet because it looks like the SampleMechanumDrive from
 *  Roadrunner Quickstart looks good to go out of the box (ignoring the fact that there needs to be
 *  intestive tuning to get varouis contraints and other stuff). What I mean is that it might be a good
 *  idea to just use the SampleMechanumDrive this first time around so I get fimilar with the tuning
 *  process and trajectory construction and usage. The quickstart also has many tools made to tune
 *  the SampleMechanumDrive to fit our specific driveBase.
